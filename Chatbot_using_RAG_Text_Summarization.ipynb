induced delirium , case reports or meta - analyses , review articles , and articles before 2007 . after applying the exclusion criteria , our search returned 19 articles . of the 19 , nine were available as full - text english articles and were included ( table 1 ) . comparison of the nine articles dex , dexmedetomidine ; rass , richmond agitation sedation scale ; cam , confusion assessment method ; cam - icu , confusion assessment method for the icu ; maas , motor activity assessment scale ; drs , delirium rating scale ; rss , ramsay sedation scale ; icdsc , intensive care delirium screening checklist . dexmedetomidine works centrally in the locus coeruleus with a high affinity for the 2-adrenoreceptor predominantly as a sedative but also with analgesic , sympatholytic , and anxiolytic properties . it has a half - life of 2 h , does not accumulate with prolonged infusion , is metabolized in the liver , and has no active metabolites ( 6 ) . peak onset of action is 1 h from the onset of infusion . in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients , it is recommended to start with an initial 1 g / kg loading dose , then an infusion of 0.21.5 g / kg / h for a maximum of 24 h. because of an increased risk of hypotension in the bolus phase , the initial loading dose is used less commonly . doses greater than 1.5 g / kg / h do not increase clinical efficacy ( 7 ) . devabhakthuni et al . compared the use of doses less than 0.7 g / kg / h versus doses greater than 0.7 g / kg / h in a retrospective review of 127 mechanically ventilated trauma icu patients and found a higher incidence of hypotension , longer length of stay , and increased use of adjunctive ( sedative , analgesic , and antipsychotics ) medications in the high - dose group with no significant clinical benefit ( 8) . there are currently no specific guidelines for modifying the dose for elderly patients or patients with kidney or liver dysfunction but , as is the case in all geriatric ( both chronologic and physiologic ) patients , it is prudent to start at the lowest dose possible for the least amount of time to achieve the anticipated clinical endpoint . the indication for use via continuous infusion for no longer than 24 h was based on initial trials showing up to a 30% incidence of transient hypotension occurring shortly after initial dosing and was thought to be related to activation of post - synaptic alpha-2 adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle ( 4 , 9 ) . this duration limit was also meant to prevent rebound hypertension that could theoretically occur if used for longer periods , which was similar to that seen with clonidine ( 4 ) . . showed this not to be the case by maintaining individuals in the icu for a mean of 81 h on dexmedetomidine infusion ( without initial bolus ) . a 16% reduction in mean systolic blood pressure and 21% reduction in heart rate occurred over the first 4 h followed by minimal ( 10% ) changes throughout the infusion ( 5 ) . these blood pressure and heart rate changes were anticipated and less severe than those seen during initiation boluses with the recommended dosing . no significant cardiovascular rebound phenomenon was seen with abrupt cessation of dexmedetomidine , and systolic blood pressure and heart rate monitored for 24 h rose by only 7 and 11% , respectively ( 5 ) . additional reported adverse events with dexmedetomidine , in addition to hypotension , include hypertension ( in setting of bolus or rapid intravenous administration when alpha-2b adrenoreceptors are activated in the periphery resulting in vasoconstriction ) , nausea , bradycardia , heart block , and sinus arrest ( 10 ) . the latter occurred in the setting of the loading bolus dose , providing even more evidence to not use an initial bolus dose and also explaining why dose titrations should occur slowly and not exceed an interval less than 30 min . given these reported adverse events , dexmedetomidine should theoretically be used with caution or avoided in those older individuals with significant cardiac disease , especially conduction abnormalities . due to changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics often seen in the elderly , small dose or frequency changes most elderly patients are on more than 45 medications to begin with , and when combined with a medication such as dexmedetomidine , this can produce rapidly worsening side effects and consequences . hence , the  starting low , going slow approach must be used . in the midex trial comparing dexmedetomidine with midazolam , although hypotension and bradycardia were observed with increased frequency in the study group [ midazolam : 11.6% hypotension , 5.2% bradycardia versus dexmedetomidine : 20.6% hypotension ( p=0.007 ) , bradycardia 14.2% ( p<0.001 ) ] , these adverse effects rarely necessitated stopping the study in all study groups despite noting cardiovascular dysfunction in 61% of the patients in the dexmedetomidine arm and 60.2% of the midazolam arm of patients at baseline ( 10 ) . showed that the sympatholysis caused by the centrally acting alpha-2 receptor blockade of dexmedetomidine may mitigate the deleterious cardiovascular effects of acute cocaine overdose ( 11 ) . the primary advantage of dexmedetomidine over agents such as benzodiazepines or opiates is that it is able to adequately sedate the patient but with less respiratory depression and allows patients to remain more awake and interactive ( 6 , 10 ) . its use is advantageous during extubation , as it exerts sedative and analgesic properties to counterbalance stress while maintaining hemodynamic stability and preserving cognitive function ( 12 ) . in situations where patients must be able to interact with clinicians , for example , in neurosurgical patients , post - operative ventilated patients must be woken up to obtain serial neurological exams . the reliability of the clinical neurologic exam hampered by the sedation caused by other agents is preserved with dexmedetomidine . it has also been used as a palliative adjunct to help control symptoms and stressors , while maintaining a level of alertness not seen with high - dose benzodiazepines and/or opiates . although the cost of the medication itself may be more than older agents , the potential cost savings that could result from less mechanical ventilation time , decreased time in the icu , and decreased incidence of anesthetic or icu - related delirium are enormous . a large proportion of studies have focused on treating delirium once its onset has been identified . strategies to identify delirium include the confusion assessment method ( cam ) ( 3 ) , the delirium rating scale  revised-98 ( 13 ) , and the delirium symptom interview ( 14 ) . among the slew of causes of delirium , including infection , cardiogenic , metabolic , physical injury , and endocrine , almost all classes of medications can also precipitate delirium , but some , such as haloperidol , can treat and even prevent the onset of such symptoms ( 15 ) . table 1 summarizes the findings of the nine specific studies included in our analysis of dexmedetomidine and other study drugs such as lorazepam , propofol , and midazolam . overall , it was noted that dexmedetomidine had much better outcomes with regard to delirium than any of the other study drugs used . a few studies in particular are important to note . a double - blind , randomized controlled trial was done by pandharipande et al . on 106 adult mechanically ventilated medical and surgical icu patients at two tertiary care centers ( 16 ) . this study compared lorazepam to dexmedetomidine to determine whether the duration of delirium and coma in mechanically ventilated icu patients could be reduced while providing adequate sedation . they were able to show more delirium - free days as compared to the study drug lorazepam . patients were also more apt to be able to complete post - icu neuropsychological testing evaluating global , cognitive , motor speed , and attention functions ( 16 ) . the 28-day mortality in the dexmedetomidine group was 17% vs. 27% in the lorazepam group ( p=0.18 ) with the 12-month time to death was 363 days in the dexmedetomidine group vs. 188 days in the lorazepam group ( p=0.48 ) . this reduction in delirium , coupled with the overall decreased morbidity and mortality , makes the use of dexmedetomidine a very appealing agent in icu care . riker et al . ( 17 ) conducted a prospective , double - blind , randomized trial in 68 centers in five countries looking at the use of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam in 375 medical / surgical icu patients with expected mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h. the cam - icu negative and positive patients were assessed at baseline and after administration of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam with encouraging results . \\n for the cam - icu  negative at study enrollment , the effect of dexmedetomidine treatment measured by generalized estimating equation ( gee ) was a 15.4% decrease ( 95% ci , 2 to 29% ; p=0.02 ) , with a delirium prevalence of 32.9% ( 25/76 ) in dexmedetomidine - treated patients versus 55.0% ( 22/40 , p=0.03 ) in the midazolam arm of treatment . for those cam - icu  positive at baseline , the dexmedetomidine treatment effect measured by gee was a 32.2% reduction ( 95% ci , 21 to 43% ; p=0.001 ) , with a prevalence of 68.7% ( 90/131 ) for dexmedetomidine - treated patients versus 95.5% ( 63/66 ) for midazolam - treated patients ( p=0.001 ) . the overall prevalence of delirium during treatment was 54% in dexmedetomidine group and 76.6% in the midazolam group . patients also showed improved communication and interaction while on dexmedetomidine in the study done by jakob et al . ( 10 ) , with a visual analog scale ( vas ) estimated score difference of 19.7 ( 95% ci , 15.224.2 ) , p=0.001 , as compared to midazolam and 11.2 ( 95% ci , 6.415.9 ) , p=0.001 , as compared to propofol in the midex and prodex trials , respectively . the intent of this study was to compare these agents in maintaining sedation , reducing duration of mechanical ventilation , and improving patients interaction with nursing care . this was carried out as a two - phase three multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial . as per the studies evaluated in this paper , one may extrapolate that improved communication and appropriate sedation level could lead to more appropriate use of medications known to precipitate delirium , including analgesics ( opiates ) , anxiolytics ( benzodiazepines ) , and antipsychotics . dexmedetomidine was effective in reducing many of the major triggers of delirium in the elderly icu patient , namely time on mechanical ventilation , time in the icu , and stress related to inability to make needs known . there is a growing body of literature in the palliative care arena advocating the use of a low - dose infusion of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to treating opiate resistant pain . there has been success in the use of this drug as both a fast - acting analgesic and light sedative that manages symptoms and , by allowing for continued patient interaction , avoids palliative sedation in situations of intractable pain ( 24 ) . coyne et al . , who looked at the potential role of dexmedetomidine as a bridge to obtaining effective analgesia , proposed a protocol for a low - dose infusion of dexmedetomidine in patients on a palliative care service to be used as ,  an adjunctive analgesic for refractory pain , may be opioid sparing , and provides a mild sedative effect ( 24 ) . case reports in the palliative care field report on the ability to provide analgesia , anxiolysis , and  conscious sedation to allow for control of symptoms while preserving precious time with patients and loved ones ( 25 ) . future studies may look at this type of protocol in patients at high risk of delirium , admitted to the icu , but not in a terminal state requiring palliative care , to see if symptoms can be controlled adequately with decreased incidence of delirium . this is an exciting hypothesis that could have vast potentials in managing the critically ill geriatric patients . delirium triggers a cascade of iatrogenic reflexes often leading to polypharmacy and adverse drug effects ; unnecessary and uncomfortable tests , procedures , and interventions ; cognitive decline ; deconditioning ; hospital - acquired infections ; skin breakdown ; and family / caregiver stress . the icu environment , as well as the severity of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions used there , is incredibly distressing to any patient , and even more so to the elderly individual . patients with delirium have a 62% increase in mortality at 1 year compared to those without delirium ( 26 ) . compared to those who avoid delirium , individuals who become delirious have significantly higher rates of institutionalization and cognitive decline in the year following an episode ( 2 , 26 ) . delirium in the icu portends adverse clinical outcomes at 6 months , including a threefold risk of death , longer hospitalizations , longer times on mechanical ventilation , and higher rates of cognitive impairment ( 27 ) . therefore , prevention and , if needed , treatment are the keys to improving outcomes . a natural conclusion is that delirium should decrease with both less exposure to delirium - precipitating medications , as well as the patient being more awake , alert , and participatory in their care . non - pharmacologic treatments should always be explored first , especially concerning the geriatric population of patients ; however , when pharmacologic agents are warranted , those that can achieve stated goals with the least amount of side effects and least risk of precipitating delirium should be utilized . habit and comfort level should no longer be acceptable reasons for choosing a medication , which is not substantiated by evidence . the nine articles used in this study outlined the use of dexmedetomidine as a newer agent that has proven to be effective . the ages of the patients included show that patients , including the geriatric population , may benefit from such intervention as it may have applications in preventing delirium in high - risk geriatric icu patients . it appears that dexmedetomidine might be a viable option for all , including those with more serious medical conditions such as underlying heart disease ( as proven by the midex trial ) , but more research is needed to safely conclude so . all variables still have to be individualized per each patient based on their medical history and overall functional state ; however , these nine articles prove promising results , if dexmedetomidine is used correctly and with close monitoring . the authors have not received any funding or benefits from industry or elsewhere to conduct this study .\",\n          \"traumatic injuries that separate the entire anterior mandibular gingiva and alveolar mucosa from the underlying bone expose the alveolar process and mental tubercle from marginal bone down to the mandibular inferior border . as can be expected , the applied shear forces to the mentum and lower lip are responsible for this condition , whereas elective vestibular incisions , which are made in the mandibular anterior area for genioplasty , orthognathic surgeries , and trauma - treatment surgeries make two layer closure of the wound amenable . these incisions are made below the attached gingiva with a cuff of the alveolar mucosa and mentalis muscle attached to the mandible . furthermore , supplemental lower face bandage after surgery is also recommended . on the other hand , the management of a severe form of mandibular degloving injury , that leads to complete full thickness separation of soft tissue from mandible , with delay in referral and infection of the open wound , is fully discussed . a 14-years - old male with a history of  fall  trauma , of his bicycle , experienced soft tissue injuries in the maxillofacial region . the patient , one week later , was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of mashhad 's university for the management of the lacerated intraoral soft tissue wound in mandibular anterior region . in the extraoral examination , moreover , silk suture in the lower labial vestibule , from unsuccessful attempts to repair severed mucosa , was noted . furthermore , debris , necrotic tissue , and exposed bone were present in the vestibular depth [ figure 1 ] . complete mandibular degloving injury exposing mandibular bone from marginal bone to inferior border the patient 's hospital discharge card emphasized that tetanus prophylaxis has been introduced . brain ct scans and orthopantogram were also carried out . after the administration of local anesthesia ( lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1/80000 ) , debridement of necrotic soft tissue and copious irrigation with high pressure volumes of normal saline was rendered . in the next step , suturing of soft tissue was attempted . firstly , bone between the left lower canine and lateral lower incisor root was penetrated by a surgical round bur ( number 2 ) . secondly , 3 - 0 plain gut suture in 26 mm curved needle was modified to straight one so that it can be passed through this hole and exit through the lingual mucosa . by the means of this plain gut suture , the buccal soft tissue flap , 10 mm below free margin , was grasped and sutured to the lingual mucosa [ figure 2 ] . likewise , the same procedure was repeated on the right side in the intact bone , apical to the avulsed lateral incisor . bone suture of the alveolar bone between the left canine and the lateral incisor furthermore , despite of the intact remaining lower anterior teeth and supporting bone , essig wiring technique was applied to support the mucosal free edge suturing [ figure 3 ] . as far as medications are concerned , clindamycin antibiotic 150 mg tabs qid was prescribed for one week . analgesics ( acetaminophen 500 mg ) and cholorhexidine mouthwash were also ordered . additionally , proper manner of tooth brushing was emphasized to the patient and parents . vertical mucosal tear in the midline heals by secondary epithelialization the follow - up , which was carried out for one month after the treatment , has shown excellent results . four weeks after treatment ; excellent healing of gingiva . note the scar tissue in the center of the lip that healed by secondary intention degloving injury occurs most commonly in lower and upper extremities whenever strong shear forces are applied . for most instances , similarly , in the oral cavity , the term maxillary degloving applies to the special surgical incisions in maxillary vestibular mucosa and endonasal incisions that give access to the midface . moreover , gingival degloving term is defined as soft tissue injury , in which full thickness separation of the gingiva from alveolar bone takes place . likewise , mandibular degloving injury is a traumatic separation of the alveolar mucosa from the mandible in a full thickness manner extending to the inferior border of the mandible . usually , mandibular degloving injuries take place in mvas , falls , and sport injuries , like skiing and biking . if immediate treatment of these injuries is to be considered , where soft tissues and mucosal remnants on mandibular are preserved , then primary suturing is indicated , whereas in late referral patients healing by secondary intention takes place , which is slow and accompanied with scar formation . anterior mandibular vestibular sulcus deepening and food entrapment are of the disadvantages of secondary intention wound healing in this region . bone suturing techniques in oral cavity operations are reported as useful aid in implant dentistry , vestibuloplasy , and cleft palate surgeries . nevertheless , the authors experience in a trauma center points out that the prevalence of this condition is much more than that reported . the case previously mentioned shows the difficulty of primary suturing in the mandibular degloving injuries . alternatively , bone suturing with essig wiring technique for primary healing has shown better results and , therefore , it is obviously more recommended .\",\n          \"complications after esophagectomy occur in up to 40% of cases [ 1 , 2 ] . pneumonia , respiratory failure , and anastomotic leaks are the most common early complications in the first postoperative week . the most common late complication , usually developing after several weeks or months , is anastomotic stenosis [ 13 ] . hiatal hernia after esophagectomy occurs in both the early and late postoperative period with a frequency of 0.46% [ 15 ] . a 34-year - old woman was admitted with squamous cell cancer of the cervical esophagus . she underwent total hybrid mckeown resection of the esophagus ( vats with laparotomy and cervicotomy ) with pharyngogastric anastomosis as well as microjejunostomy , pyloromyoplasty , the kocher maneuver , and three - field lymphadenectomy . stage ia oral contrast x - ray examination revealed stenosis of the pylorus at the level of the hiatus ( figs . a decision was made to perform a reoperation , which included colon repositioning , hiatal plasty , and right hemicolectomy due to ischemia and necrosis . the postoperative period was complicated by peritonitis , which was successfully treated with peritoneal lavage . a  oral x - ray examination with contrast performed on the 7 postoperative day after esophagectomy . b  horizontal computed tomography ( ct ) image : the colon protruding into the mediastinum .  final oral x - ray examination with contrast : restoration of stomach graft patency the 32-year - old patient was admitted to our department with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma between the middle and the lower thirds of the esophagus . subtotal minimally invasive esophagectomy ( laparoscopy with vats and cervicotomy ) and two - field lymphadenectomy were performed . compression of the stomach graft by the colon protruding into the mediastinum through the esophageal hiatus was confirmed with computed tomography ( figs . a decision was made to perform a reoperation using a laparotomy approach ; the displaced colon was repositioned , plasty of the hiatus was performed , and the colonic mesentery was stabilized . oral x - ray examination with contrast , performed on the 7 postoperative day  normal view . b  displacement of the colon into the mediastinum and left pleural cavity 12 months after the operation . c  horizontal computed tomography ( ct ) image : the colon protruding into the mediastinum and left pleural cavity . by 2011 , 82 cases of postesophagectomy hiatal hernia had been described in the literature . reports of 108 postoperative hiatal hernias , including the cases described by the present authors , have been found in the database so far [ 3 , 4 , 610 ] . the colon , small intestine , omentum , and even spleen can be found in postoperative hiatal hernias [ 1 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 ] . the most dramatic cases involving strangulation followed by ischemia of the colon or small intestine required additional resection [ 1 , 5 , 7 , 10 ] . this situation took place in the first reported case . the risk factors for the development of hiatal hernia include intraperitoneal pressure exceeding thoracic pressure and distension of the esophageal hiatus [ 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 ] . postoperative hiatal hernias occur more often after minimally invasive ( 2.726% ) or robotic ( up to 19.4% ) esophagectomy than after conventional procedures because of the surgical technique [ 1 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 ] . in both presented cases , the displaced organ was the transverse colon . in our opinion , the transverse colon is more susceptible to displacement when freed during the skeletonization of the greater gastric curvature , kocher s maneuver , and potential omentectomy than intestinal loops stabilized by microjejunostomy . intraoperative plasty of the esophageal hiatus or mesh implantation is recommended in order to prevent postesophagectomy hiatal hernia [ 4 , 5 , 7 ] . moreover , the two cases differed with regard to the technical details of the operations , making it difficult to determine the main cause of colonic displacement . the most likely reason seemed to be the relatively long mesentery of the colon and the associated joint traction of the graft and the colonic mesentery into the mediastinum . the abdominal approach is preferred , with a growing frequency of laparoscopy [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 ] . in the event of technical difficulties , additional thoracic access or even typical\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract_text_combined\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49981,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"background : applying an effective management system in emergency incidents provides maximum efficiency with using minimum facilities and human resources .   hospital emergency incident command system ( heics ) is one of the most reliable emergency incident command systems to make hospitals more efficient and to increase patient safety .   this research was to study requirements , barriers , and strategies of heics in hospitals affiliated to isfahan university of medical sciences ( iums).methods : this was a qualitative research carried out in isfahan province , iran during 2008 - 09 .   the study population included senior hospital managers of iums and key informants in emergency incident management across isfahan province .   sampling method was in non - random purposeful form and snowball technique was used .   the research instrument for data collection was semi - structured interview ;

            "[\"a recent systematic analysis showed that in 2011 , 314 ( 296 - 331 ) million children younger than 5 years were mildly , moderately or severely stunted and 258 ( 240 - 274 ) million were mildly , moderately or severely underweight in the developing countries . in iran a study among 752 high school girls in sistan and baluchestan showed prevalence of 16.2% , 8.6% and 1.5% , for underweight , overweight and obesity , respectively . the prevalence of malnutrition among elementary school aged children in tehran varied from 6% to 16% . anthropometric study of elementary school students in shiraz revealed that 16% of them suffer from malnutrition and low body weight . snack should have 300 - 400 kcal energy and could provide 5 - 10 g of protein / day . nowadays , school nutrition programs are running as the national programs , world - wide . national school lunch program in the united states there are also some reports regarding school feeding programs in developing countries . in vietnam , school base program showed an improvement in nutrient intakes . in iran a national free food program ( nffp ) is implemented in elementary schools of deprived areas to cover all poor students . however , this program is not conducted in slums and poor areas of the big cities so many malnourished children with low socio - economic situation are not covered by nffp . although the rate of poverty in areas known as deprived is higher than other areas , many students in deprived areas are not actually poor and can afford food . hence , nutritional value of the nffp is lower than the scientific recommended snacks for this age group . furthermore , lack of variety of food packages has decreased the tendency of children toward nffp . on the other hand , the most important one is ministry of education ( moe ) of iran , which is responsible for selecting and providing the packages for targeted schools . the ministry of health ( moh ) is supervising the health situation of students and their health needs . welfare organizations , along with charities , have the indirect effect on nutritional status of students by financial support of their family . provincial governors have also the role of coordinating and supervising all activities of these organizations . parent - teacher association is a community - based institution that participates in school 's policy such as nffp . in addition to these organizations , nutritional literacy of students , their parents and teachers , is a very important issue , which could affect nutritional status of school age children . therefore , the present study was conducted with the aim of improving the nffp , so that by its resources all poor children will be covered even in big cities . moreover , all food packages were replaced by nutritious and diverse packages that were accessible for non - poor children . according to the aim of this study and multiple factors that could affect the problem , public health advocacy has been chosen as the best strategy to deal with this issue . therefore , the present study determines the effects of nutrition intervention in an advocacy process model on the prevalence of underweight in school aged children in the poor area of shiraz , iran . this interventional study has been carried out between 2009 and 2010 in shiraz , iran . this survey was approved by the research committee of shiraz university of medical sciences . in coordination with education organization of fars province two elementary schools and one middle school in the third region of the urban area of shiraz were selected randomly . in those schools all students ( 2897 , 7 - 13 years old ) were screened based on their body mass index ( bmi ) by nutritionists . according to convenience method all students divided to two groups based on their economic situation ; family revenue and head of household 's job and nutrition situation ; the first group were poor and malnourished students and the other group were well nourished or well - off students . for this report , the children 's height and weight were entered into center for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) to calculate bmi and bmi - for - age z - scores based on cdc for diseases control and prevention and growth standards . the significance of the difference between proportions was calculated using two - tailed z - tests for independent proportions . for implementing the interventions , the advocacy process model weight was to the nearest 0.1 kg on a balance scale ( model # seca scale ) . standing height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a wall - mounted stadiometer . advocacy group formation : this step was started with stakeholder analysis and identifying the stakeholders . the team was formed with representatives of all stakeholders include ; education organization , welfare organization , deputy for health of shiraz university , food and cosmetic product supervisory office and several non - governmental organizations and charities . situation analysis : this was carried out by use of existing data such as formal report of organizations , literature review and focus group with experts . the prevalence of malnutrition and its related factors among students was determined and weaknesses and strengths of the nffp were analyzed . accordingly , three sub - groups were established : research and evaluation , education and justification and executive group . designing the strategies : three strategies were identified ; education and justification campaign , nutritional intervention ( providing nutritious , safe and diverse snacks ) and networking . performing the interventions : interventions that were implementing in selected schools were providing a diverse and nutritious snack package along with nutrition education for both groups while the first group ( poor and malnourished students ) was utilized the package free of charge . education and justification intervention : regarding the literature review and expert opinion , an educational group affiliated with the advocacy team has prepared educational booklets about nutritional information for each level ( degree ) . accordingly , education of these booklets has been integrated into regular education of students and they educated and justified for better nutrition life - style . it leads the educational group to hold several meeting with the student 's parents to justify them about the project and its benefit for their children . after these meetings , parental desire for participation in the project illustrated the effectiveness of the justification meeting with them . for educate fifteen talk show programs in tv and radio , 12 published papers in the local newspaper , have implemented to mobilize the community and gain their support . healthy diet , the importance of breakfast and snack in adolescence , wrong food habits among school age children , role of the family to improve food habit of children were the main topics , in which media campaign has focused on . nutritional intervention : the snack basket of the students was replaced with traditional , nutritious and diverse foods . in general , the new snack package in average has provided 380 kcal energy , 15 g protein along with sufficient calcium and iron . low economic and malnourished children were supported by executive group affiliated with advocacy team and the rest of them prepare their snack by themselves . research and evaluation : in this step , the literacy and anthropometric indices ( bmi ) of students were assessed before and after the interventions . the reference for anthropometric measures was the world health organization / national center for health statistics ( who / nchs ) standards and the cut - offs were - two standard deviations ( sd ) from the mean . each student that was malnourished and poor has been taken into account for free food and nutritious snacks . demographic information , height , weight and knowledge of the students were measured by use of a validated and reliable ( cronbach 's alpha was 0.61 ) questionnaire . this project is granted by shiraz university of medical sciences , charities and welfare organization and education organization of fars province . statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) software , version 17.0 ( spss inc . , the results are expressed as mean  sd and proportions as appropriated . in order to determine the effective variables on the malnutrition status paired t test was used to compare the end values with baseline ones in each group . in this project , the who z - score cut - offs used were as follow : using bmi - for - age z - scores ; overweight : > + 1 sd , i.e. , z - score > 1 ( equivalent to bmi 25 kg / m ) , obesity : > + 2 sd ( equivalent to bmi 30 kg / m ) , thinness : < 2 sd and severe thinness : < 3 sd . this interventional study has been carried out between 2009 and 2010 in shiraz , iran . this survey was approved by the research committee of shiraz university of medical sciences . in coordination with education organization of fars province two elementary schools and one middle school in the third region of the urban area of shiraz were selected randomly . in those schools all students ( 2897 , 7 -

sided p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant . in this project , the who z - score cut - offs used were as follow : using bmi - for - age z - scores ; overweight : > + 1 sd , i.e. , z - score > 1 ( equivalent to bmi 25 kg / m ) , obesity : > + 2 sd ( equivalent to bmi 30 kg / m ) , thinness : < 2 sd and severe thinness : < 3 sd . study population contains 2897 children ; 70.8% were primary school students and 29.2% were secondary school students . 2336 ( 80.5% ) out of total students were well - off and 561 children ( 19.5% ) were indigent . 19.5% of subjects were in case group ( n = 561 ) and 80.5% were in the control group ( n = 2336 ) . the mean of age in welfare group was 10.0  2.3 and 10.5  2.5 in non - welfare group . demographic characteristics of school aged children in shiraz , iran table 2 shows the frequency of subjects in different categories of bmi for age in non - welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately among boys and girls before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz , iran . the frequency of subjects with bmi lower than < 2 sd decreased significantly after intervention among non - welfare girls ( p < 0.01 ) . however , there were no significant decreases in the frequency of subjects with bmi lower than < 2 sd boys . when we assess the effect of intervention in total population without separating by sex groups , we found no significant change in this population [ table 3 ] . bmi for age for iranian students aged 7 - 14 years based on gender according to who growth standards 2007 bmi for age for iranian students aged 7 - 14 years according to who growth standards 2007 in non - welfare and welfare groups of total population table 4 has shown the prevalence of normal bmi , mild , moderate and severe malnutrition in non - welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately among boys and girls before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model . according to this table there were no significant differences in the prevalence of mild , moderate and severe malnutrition among girls and boys . table 4 also shows the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys . the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001 ) . bmi , height and weight in non - welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately in males and females before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz , iran according to study 's finding the odds ratio ( or ) of sever thinness and thinness in non - welfare compared with welfare is 3.5 ( or = 3.5 , confidence interval [ ci ] = 2.5 - 3.9 , p < 0.001 ) . furthermore , the finding showed or of overweight and obesity in welfare compared to non - welfare is 19.3 ( or = 19.3 , ci = 2.5 - 3.9 , p = 0.04 ) . the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe . community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children .\", \"the morphology of the cervix changes during pregnancy or labor and the individual differences are related to intrapartum functional characteristics 1 , 2 . specifically , the morphology of the cervix between nullipara and multipara are different and this is easily recognized in the clinical field . these differences may be due to microscopical changes in the content of water , elastin , collagen , etc . , of the cervix tissues 1 , 3 . the cervical differences could cause different intrapartum cervical progression between nullipara and multipara . cervical morphology and volume are more easily and accurately determined by a 3d ultrasound when compared to conventional 2d ultrasound 4 - 7 . however , many studies which research cervical changes during pregnancies , often use 2d ultrasound 1 , 8 , 9 . although there have been a number of recent studies using 3d ultrasound to determine cervical volume 10 , 11 , this number may be considered insufficient . in this study , we measured the cervical length , volume and width using both , a 2d and 3d ultrasound in pregnant women and compared these results to the patient 's parity , previous delivery mode and previous labor . this study was conducted between january 2009 and december 2010 in healthy singleton pregnant women , who had received routine antenatal care at the department of obstetrics , catholic university saint vincent 's hospital . transvaginal sonographic evaluation of the cervixes was performed when measuring nuchal translucency in the 1st trimester and when measuring the fetal anatomical structures in the 2nd trimester . at this time women with history of cervical conization , uterine malformation , cervical incompetence , painful regular uterine contractions and history of preterm delivery were excluded . sonographic examinations were performed with a 3 - 8 mhz 3d vaginal transducer ( accuvix xq-3d , medison , seoul , korea ) . if the cervical canal was not in a straight line , the cervical length was divided into two or more lengths and added together . cervical width ( the distance from anterior to posterior cervix , perpendicular to the midline of endocervical canal ) was also measured . after measuring cervical length and width ( to determine cervical volume ) , the same transvaginal probe was changed to 3d mode . once all contours had been drawn , the volume of the cervix was calculated automatically . clinical information such as maternal age , parity , previous delivery mode and previous delivery events were gathered from medical records . according to parity then the multipara groups were further classified by the delivery mode into ' previous cesarean section group ' and ' previous vaginal delivery group ' . again , the previous cesarean section group was classified by those who underwent labor ( labor group ) and those who did not ( elective group ) . all statistical analyses were performed by sas version 8 ( sas institute inc , cary , usa ) . an unpaired t - test was used to compare the demographic characteristics and cervical parameters of nullipara and multipara in 1st and 2nd trimesters . a one - way anova was also used to compare demographic characteristics and cervical parameters of each group . one hundred and twenty - one women in the 1st trimester and 233 women in the 2nd trimester , totaling 354 women participated in this study . of 1st trimester participants , 41and 80 participants were considered as nullipara and multipara , respectively . of 2nd trimester participants , 88 and 145 were considered nullipara and multipara , respectively . multipara women were all older than nullipara women in both 1st and 2nd trimesters ( p<0.05 ) . the mean gestational ages on performed ultrasound examinations were 11.250.75 weeks in 1st trimester and 23.072.37 weeks in the 2nd trimester . there were no significant differences between parity , previous delivery mode or labor ( table 1 , table 2 ) . the average cervical length in 1st trimester group was significantly longer than that of the 2nd trimester group ( 4.080.72 vs. 3.890.85 cm , p=0.041 ) . the average cervical volume in 2nd trimester group was significantly greater than that of 1st trimester group ( 39.2911.18 cm3 vs. 31.4212.12 cm3 , p<0.001 ) . average cervical width in the 2nd trimester group was significantly wider than that of 1st trimester group ( 3.590.55 cm vs. 3.080.49 cm , p<0.001 ) ( table 3 ) . cervical parameters by parity , previous delivery mode and labor were not statistically significant between 1st trimester groups ( table 1 , table 2 ) . in the 2nd trimester , cervical lengths in : nullipara was 3.920.78 cm ; multipara was 3.880.89 cm ; the elective group was 4.000.99 cm ; the labor group was 3.690.74 cm , and the previous vaginal delivery group was 3.890.68 cm . 2nd trimester cervical length parameters were also not significantly different between the elective group , the labor group and previous vaginal delivery group ( p=0.204 ) ( table 2 ) . in the 2nd trimester , the cervical volume in : nullipara was 35.969.81 cm3 ; multipara was 41.3011.55 cm3 ; the elective group was 34.739.75 cm3 ; the labor group was 40.6410.66 cm3 , and the previous vaginal delivery group was 43.1011.87 cm3 . multipara groups were found to have a larger volume than nullipara groups ( p=0.002 ) . the previous vaginal delivery group had a significantly larger volume when compared with the nullipara and elective groups ( p<0.001 ) . however , there were no significant differences between the nullipara , elective and labor groups . there were also no significant differences between the labor group and the previous vaginal delivery group ( table 2 ) . the following 2nd trimester cervical widths were determined : 3.420.51 cm for the nullipara group ; 3.70.54 cm for the multipara groups ; 3.380.32 cm for the elective group ; 3.760.49 cm for the labor group and 3.740.57 cm for the previous vaginal delivery group . in general , labor and previous vaginal delivery groups were wider than the nullipara and elective group ( p<0.001 ) . cervical width was not statistically significant between the nullipara and elective group , the labor group and the vaginal delivery group , respectively ( table 1 , table 2 ) . cervical parameters measured in 1st and 2nd trimester did not show significant differences as parity increased ( table 4 ) . one hundred and twenty - one women in the 1st trimester and 233 women in the 2nd trimester , totaling 354 women participated in this study . of 1st trimester participants , 41and 80 participants were considered as nullipara and multipara , respectively . of 2nd trimester participants , 88 and 145 were considered nullipara and multipara , respectively . multipara women were all older than nullipara women in both 1st and 2nd trimesters ( p<0.05 ) . the mean gestational ages on performed ultrasound examinations were 11.250.75 weeks in 1st trimester and 23.072.37 weeks in the 2nd trimester . there were no significant differences between parity , previous delivery mode or labor ( table 1 , table 2 ) . the average cervical length in 1st trimester group was significantly longer than that of the 2nd trimester group ( 4.080.72 vs. 3.890.85 cm , p=0.041 ) . the average cervical volume in 2nd trimester group was significantly greater than that of 1st trimester group ( 39.2911.18 cm3 vs. 31.4212.12 cm3 , p<0.001 ) . average cervical width in the 2nd trimester group was significantly wider than that of 1st trimester group ( 3.590.55 cm vs. 3.080.49 cm , p<0.001 ) ( table 3 ) . cervical parameters by parity , previous delivery mode and labor were not statistically significant between 1st trimester groups ( table 1 , table 2 ) . in the 2nd trimester , cervical lengths in : nullipara was 3.920.78 cm ; multipara was 3.880.89 cm ; the elective group was 4.000.99 cm ; the labor group was 3.690.74 cm , and the previous vaginal delivery group was 3.890.68 cm . 2nd trimester cervical length parameters were also not significantly different between the elective group , the labor group and previous vaginal delivery group ( p=0.204 ) ( table 2 ) . in the 2nd trimester , the cervical volume in : nullipara was 35.969.81 cm3 ; multipara was 41.3011.55 cm3 ; the elective group was 34.739.75 cm3 ; the labor group was 40.6410.66 cm3 , and the previous vaginal delivery group was 43.1011.87 cm3 . multipara groups were found to have a larger volume than nullipara groups ( p=0.002 ) . the previous vaginal delivery group had a significantly larger volume when compared with the nullipara and elective groups ( p<0.001 ) . however , there were no significant differences between the nullipara , elective and labor groups . there were also no significant differences between the labor group and the previous vaginal delivery group ( table 2 ) . the following 2nd trimester cervical widths were determined : 3.420.51 cm for the nullipara group ; 3.70.54 cm for the multipara groups ; 3.380.32 cm for the elective group ; 3.760.49 cm for the labor group and 3.740.57 cm for the previous vaginal delivery group . in general , multipara labor and previous vaginal delivery groups were wider than the nullipara and elective group ( p<0.001 ) . cervical width was not statistically significant between the nullipara and elective group , the labor group and the vaginal delivery group , respectively ( table 1 , table 2 ) . cervical parameters measured in 1st and 2nd trimester did not show significant differences as parity increased ( table 4 ) . the use of ultrasound examination in pregnant women is preferred over digital examination because it is more accurate in determining minor progressive cervical changes 12 . it has been revealed from previous studies that the cervical morphology is different during each trimester , labor and parity ( via 2d ultrasound ) . according to zorzoli et al . , the cervix of nullipara and multipara is different however both the cesarean and nullipara groups show similar cervical morphology 1 . three - dimension ultrasound is better than the 2d ultrasound in measuring the cervical volume 6 , 7 however , as the history of 3d use is short , there is a distinct lack in the number of empirical studies describing the use of 3d ultrasound this field . recently , there have been attempts to increase the accuracy of the prediction rate of preterm birth not only by measuring the cervical length via the conventional 2d transvaginal ultrasound but also by calculating the cervical volume using the 3d transvaginal ultrasound 13 , 14 . in spite of great efforts , many studies do not show that the cervical volume is more significant than the cervical length 10 , 13 - 15 . in our study , we found cervical length to be significantly shorter in the 2nd trimester than in the 1st . there were no differences in cervical length during each trimester according to parity , previous delivery mode and previous delivery event . this result is in agreement with other studies 1 , 9 , 16 , 17 . compared to cervical length , cervical volume becomes significantly larger in the 2nd trimester than in the 1st . in a recent study , no statistically significant changes in cervical volume were found between 1st and 2nd trimester 10 . but that study was conducted in the late 1st trimester ( 11 - 14 weeks ) , whereas our study was conducted earlier in the 1st trimester ( 9 -13 weeks ) . in our present study , there was no significant difference in the cervical volume according to the parity , previous delivery mode and previous labor in 1st trimester participants , however the cervical volume was larger in the multipara group when compared to the nullipara group in the 2nd trimester . the cervical volume was larger in the previous vaginal delivery group than in the nullipara and elective groups . on the other hand , there was no significant difference in the labor group when compared to other groups . this might be due to the involvement of various cervical progressions at previous cesarean section in the labor group . this result is similar to the other studies in that the difference of cervical morphology is due to the mechanical stretching of the cervix during labor and not due to hormones 1 . unlike our results , some studies have announced that there is no difference in the cervical volume using the 3d ultrasound between the nullipara and the multipara groups 18 , 19 . but in fact , this studies did not distinguish between gestational weeks and the number of study participants was quite small ( n=130 and n=10 ) . calculated the cervical volume by 3d ultrasound from 17 to 41 of 643 participants and found similar results to our study in that the cervical volume was larger in the multipara than the nullipara groups 11 . . showed that the second and third trimester cervical volumes were increased in multiparous compared to nuliparas , but there was no significant difference in the 1st trimester 10 . yet , to date , this study is the first to describe changes in cervical volume using 3d ultrasound in relation to previous delivery mode and labor . there is no difference according to parity and previous delivery mode in the 1st trimester however , the cervical width is larger in the multipara than the nullipara group in the 2nd trimester . the cervical width is larger in women who underwent labor than in the nullipara and the elective cesarean section groups due to the mechanical change of cervical stretching during labor . the cervical volume and width have an influence on parity , previous delivery mode and labor in the 2nd trimester . the parity , previous cesarean section and previous labor must be considered when researching cervical volume and width in 2nd trimester patients . until now , studies on the prediction of preterm labor using the cervical volume have been used to apply uniform standards without considering parity , previous delivery mode and labor 10 , 13 , 14 . we expect to improve the prediction rate of preterm labor if we make individualized standards based on the results from this study and place greater importance on parity , previous delivery mode and previous labor .\", \"tardive dystonia ( td ) , a rarer side effect after longer exposure to antipsychotics , is characterized by local or general , sustained , involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle group , with twisting movements , generally slow , which may affect the limbs , trunk , neck , or face . td has been shown to develop in about 3% of patients who have had long - term exposure to antipsychotics . . the low risk of td for atypical antipsychotics is thought to result from their weak affinity for dopamine receptors . compared with typical , atypical antipsychotic agents have a greater affinity for serotonin 5-ht2a than dopamine d2 receptors , with a low propensity to induce td . among this olanzapine is thought to have preferential action at mesolimbic over nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways and is , therefore , associated with a very low incidence of extrapyramidal symptom ( eps ) . furthermore , a retrospective analysis of controlled multicentric trials suggested that olanzapine also improves preexisting symptoms of tardive movements . we report a case of 20-year - old male , belonging to lower socioeconomic class , educated up to 2 standard , presented with severe unilateral dystonic left sided neck movements [ figure 1 ] . careful history exploration revealed he was taking risperidone 2 mg irregularly for 2 months and then olanzapine 5 mg for another 4 months . picture of neck dystonia of patient at 19 years , the patient presented with occasional anger outbursts , getting provoked on small matters and beating family members , running away from home , screaming episodes occasionally , fearfulness , sleep disturbance for 2 days ; which was precipitated after fever . according to the mother , one friend might have threatened / made fun of him actually and after that patient stopped going out of house , and displayed above mentioned symptoms . this was interpreted as psychosis with persecutory ideas , and he was treated with risperidone 2 mg / day for 2 months and then with olanzapine 5 mg / day for 4 months . in last two follow - ups patient did not present himself , and mother reported unusual neck movements , which were taken as a part of his overall psychopathology and not taken seriously , slight intermittent neck movements reported were missed as part of adolescent behavior problems mimicking some hero in movies . as neck dystonia increased , the patient had a severe disability as patient had to keep his hands behind his head for the support . the movement would decrease when the patient was lying down and was absent during sleep . he even stopped taking food due to severe neck movements making chewing and swallowing difficult . his birth and early developmental milestones were normal . during 210 years of age patient was inattentive and mildly hyperactive . other siblings were educated with master 's degree , and patient was also sent to school , but due to inattention and restlessness , he did not pass 2 standard after three attempts . he left the schooling . with average executive functioning and life skills , he worked as an unskilled laborer in the neighborhood shops as a helping hand . , he was found to be getting over familiar , cheerful , moody , and short tempered . sometimes , the patient had inappropriate social judgment ; for which his friends made fun of him , and teased him . on mental status assessment , routine investigations , thyroid function tests , electroencephalogram , fundus examination , cervical x - ray , magnetic resonance imaging brain were normal . after consulting neurophysician , wilson 's disease and other secondary causes of dystonia were ruled out . the patient was treated with clonazepam 1 mg total dissolved solid ( tds ) , tetrabenazine 25 mg tds , trihexiphenidyl 2 mg bipolar disorder ( bd ) . after 2 months , there was some improvement of around 30% . baclofen 10 mg was added ; increased up to 20 mg , trihexyphenidyl reduced to 2 mg . with little improvement after 4 months of treatment for dystonia , levodopa + carbidopa ( 100 + 25 ) was added by neurophysician and increased up to  tablet tds and baclofen omitted . after 12 months of treatment , patient has improved around 90% with tetrabenazine 75 mg , levodopa + carbidopa ( 100 + 25 ) -  tablet bd , and clonazepam 1 mg bd . earlier case reports reported td developing with high - dose atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine 20 mg or aripiprazole 15 mg with longer duration of exposure of around 1215 months in established psychiatric illness like schizophrenia or any other psychotic illness . eps in general and tardive dyskinesia , in particular , have been extensively studied in schizophrenia . even though a number of studies suggest that bipolar patients experience higher rates of eps ( parkinsonism , dystonia , akathisia ) and td compared to patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia , research within the bd population has been limited . the risk is found to be 3 to 5 times higher in elderly patients compared to young patients . in addition to age , the risk is directly proportional to : female gender , daily and total dose of the antipsychotic drug , presence of mood disorder , the use of anticholinergics with neuroleptics , previous physical therapies ( electroconvulsive therapy ) , the presence of other physical illness such as diabetes or an organic disorder , younger age of exposure , and the presence of extrapyramidal symptoms early in treatment . this patient 's severe dystonic neck movements developed within short period of 6 months of exposure to atypical antipsychotics risperidone 2 mg and then olanzapine 5 mg only , which can cause minimal extrapyramidal side effects . in this case , risk factors for developing serious disabling td were neuroleptic exposure , borderline intellectual functioning , externalizing behavior , probable misdiagnosis , and overlooking early indicators of side effects . this case highlights dangers of casually prescribing low dose second generation antipsychotics in patient with hyperthymic temperament and borderline intellectual functioning with vague short lasting presenting complaints ; probably misdiagnosed as psychosis ; leading to such severe adverse effects because patients with organic brain damage are more prone to develop adverse effects like td . thus , judicious use of antipsychotics , with detailed and frequent assessments is important , and emergent stereotyped behavior or unexplained movements must be examined carefully and taken seriously . the authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms . in the form the patient(s ) has / have given his / her / their consent for his / her / their images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal . the patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity , but anonymity can not be guaranteed . the authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms . in the form the patient(s ) has / have given his / her / their consent for his / her / their images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal . the patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity , but anonymity can not be guaranteed .\", 'lepidoptera include agricultural pests that , through feeding and other activities , negatively affect stored grains , food and fiber crops [ 2 , 3 ] . since a single lepidoptera adult can produce hundreds of eggs , and their primary food source is typically plant material , they can cause significant damage to agricultural crops . although biological agents can help manage these insect pests , insecticides currently are essential for large - scale effective and economical pest control . these insecticides can also affect non - target organisms , including pollinators , and their application not only disrupts natural ecosystems but also reduces yields of crops that rely on pollination [ 5 , 6 ] . the non - target effect of some pesticides is in part due to their effects on insect immunity , which is necessary for insect survival in natural environments . for example , currently used pesticides have been shown to affect cellular [ 710 ] and humoral [ 11 , 12 ] immune responses and interfere with grooming behavior [ 13 , 14 ] . these effects on immunity are likely non - specific and negatively impact the health of both the target pest and beneficial arthropods . therefore , there is a need for novel target - specific approaches to control insect pests without affecting beneficial arthropods . although immune pathways can be generally and non - specifically inhibited by pesticides , they also are a likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target - specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes , including signaling pathways , can be under strong selection for diversification . fundamental mechanisms of innate immunity comprising cellular and humoral pathways are conserved throughout the animal kingdom   and are controlled by signaling pathways activated by various stimuli [ 17 , 18 ] , including pathogen recognition by immune surveillance systems . despite this overall conservation , aspects of immune systems are subject to strong selection to evolve in response to varying pathogen exposure and to pathogen evolution of virulence determinants that modulate immunity [ 15 , 1921 ] . such co - evolutionary dynamics can promote diversification of conserved elements of immunity as well as the recruitment of novel effectors . as such , the investigation of insect immune pathways and mechanisms of pathogen modulation can yield insights into components that may be susceptible to inhibition . for example , the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila suppresses cellular and humoral immunity in the lepidopteran moths manduca sexta and spodoptera exigua [ 23 , 24 ] but not in the dipteran fly drosophila melanogaster , suggesting the stage of immunity suppressed by x. nematophila may be absent from d. melanogaster , but present in lepidoptera . since dipteran flies serve as pollinators [ 26 , 27 ] , decomposers , food sources for other animals , and pest control agents , capitalizing on the possible differences between dipteran and lepidopteran immune signaling cascades will help in the identification of targets for pest - specific inhibition . with this knowledge in hand , pest management can be achieved by developing small molecule inhibitors of these targets that will suppress pest insect immunity and lead to increased susceptibility to environmental pathogens . indeed , many insecticides may contribute to insect ( target and non - target ) death by modulating aspects of immunity . the feasibility of targeted pest control via insect immune inhibition has been established for termites ; a small molecule inhibitor of an immune surveillance protein led to faster termite death upon exposure to various pathogens . much of our current knowledge of insect immune signaling pathways and receptor and effector function is based on the premiere model organism d. melanogaster , for which there are extensive genetic tools and several fully sequenced genomes . well - established lepidopteran insect models such as the silkworm bombyx mori and the tobacco hornworm m. sexta also have been widely used to study insect immunity . these organisms have been particularly useful for investigating hemolymph proteins and hemocyte function because of their relatively large larval size and hemolymph volume . many insects in the order lepidoptera are easy to rear in laboratory conditions , and new tools such as rna interference have been implemented successfully to study genetics of their immune systems [ 30 , 31 ] . also , their immune signaling pathways are gradually being revealed by genomic and transcriptomic data [ 3238 ] . based on these model insect systems a fairly detailed picture of immunity , from pathogen detection to effector function , is emerging , though many gaps remain , particularly with regard to components that are unique to different insect orders . here we review aspects of insect immunity with an emphasis on the similarities and distinctions between d. melanogaster and representative lepidoptera . in insects , the cellular immune response includes phagocytosis , nodulation and encapsulation [ 3942 ] and the humoral response involves the expression of antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) [ 43 , 44 ] as well as the pro - phenol oxidase ( propo ) proteolytic cascade that results in formation of melanized nodules and toxic reactive compounds [ 45 , 46 ] . amps are small cationic peptides that insert into and disrupt microbial membranes , thereby killing and clearing pathogens . they are synthesized by hemocytes and to a greater extent in fat body from which they are released into the insect hemolymph rapidly after microbial infection [ 43 , 47 ] . amps are also expressed in extra - embryonic tissues of eggs , which may help protect the developing embryo from infection . amps are a conserved component of immunity in plants   and animals   and while they have diverse structures most can be assigned to larger families such as cecropins , attacins , defensins and diptericins . their diversity and immune effector function as well as their variant representation among insects ( table 1 ) have made them a central focus in the study of invertebrate pathology [ 30 , 52 ] . in d. melanogaster amp synthesis each of these pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) that trigger , through complex regulatory cascades , nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) dependent transcription of the genes encoding amps . after amps are translated in the cytoplasm they are released into the hemolymph where their high concentrations and broad activity are thought to enhance clearance of invading microorganisms from the insect . bioinformatic and experimental data support the existence of the amp - inducing toll and imd pathways in lepidopterans , though not all components have been identified in model organisms such as m. sexta [ 32 , 35 ] . the conserved presence of amps in immunity coupled with the possibility that certain elements of their induction pathways may vary among insects enhances the probability that microbially - induced amp expression could be inhibited in a pest - specific manner . as such , for the remainder of this review we focus on pathways leading to amp gene expression . in d. melanogaster , transcription of amp - encoding genes is activated by the nf-b family transcription factors in response to infection [ 6569 ] with distinct nf-b family transcription factors responding to the toll and immune deficiency ( imd ) signal transduction pathways . in response to toll pathway activation , the nf-b inhibitor cactus is phosphorylated and degraded allowing its targets , the nf-b factors dif and dorsal , to be translocated to the nucleus . imd pathway activity culminates in the nf-b factor relish being activated by a stimulus - induced proteolytic cleavage . in the case of dif and dorsal , gram - positive bacterial and fungal infections primarily serve as the stimuli that induce degradation of cactus through the toll signaling pathway . in general , gram - negative bacterial infections of d. melanogaster stimulate the proteolytic cleavage of relish through the imd pathway . once in the nucleus , these transcription factors drive the transcription of immune effectors , including amp genes whose promoters contain nf-b binding sites [ 70 , 72 ] . overall , nf-b proteins and their dna - binding specificities are conserved among organisms , including those lepidoptera studied to date [ 73 , 74 ] . however , the nfb - binding regions for inhibitor of b ( ib ) proteins ( e.g. , cactus ) are not conserved , suggesting diversification and co - adaptation between ib and nfb pairs . also , recent work indicates that nf-b nuclear co - regulators may contribute to species - specific regulation of amp gene expression . therefore , modulation of inhibitors and nuclear - co - regulators of nf-b - dependent transcription may be one avenue by which target - specific immune suppression could be achieved . in d. melanogaster , nf-b - dependent amp induction through the toll and imd pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) . prrs are soluble or membrane - bound proteins that bind to specific microbe associated molecular patterns ( mamps ) such as lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , lipoteichoic acid ( lta ) , peptidoglycan ( pgn ) or -1,3-glucan that are released from or are found on the cell surfaces of bacteria or fungi . upon interaction with mamps , prrs can directly agglutinate pathogens or trigger proteolytic signaling cascades and cytokine release , which in turn lead to the activation of downstream cellular and humoral pathways , including pro - po activation and amp gene expression [ 16 , 65 , 76 ] . pgn recognition proteins ( pgrps ) and -1,3-glucanase - related proteins ( grps ) were discovered in the lepidopteran silkworm ( b. mori ) by assaying for plasma components that activate the propo cascade . pgrps were subsequently shown to be conserved across mammals and insects , and in d. melanogaster their role in the induction of amp gene expression through toll and imd pathways in response to pgn has been well documented [ 7983 ] . similarly , grps have been shown to induce amp expression through toll pathway in response to fungal infections [ 79 , 84 ] . in contrast , there is a dearth of literature linking specific pgrps or grps to amp induction in lepidoptera . such a link is possible , since pgn and -1,3-glucan can activate amp gene expression in m. sexta and b. mori [ 8590 ] and multiple infection - induced pgrp- and grp - encoding genes have been identified in lepidoptera [ 32 , 38 , 54 , 55 , 9194 ] . however , there are numerous hints that lepidoptera and diptera may have evolved divergent mechanisms of linking pathogen detection to conserved toll and imd signal transduction cascades . first , a genome comparison between b. mori and d. melanogaster failed to identify 1:1 pgrp orthologs . similarly , b. mori gram - negative binding protein ( gnbp ) and m. sexta microbe binding protein ( mbp ) , members of the -1,3-glucanase - related protein superfamily [ 76 , 95 ] , appear to be distantly related to d. melanogaster gnbps , suggesting divergence of this group of proteins . m. sexta mbp expression is strongly up - regulated in fat body after immune challenge and shows specific binding to lta , lps , dap - pgn . also , in contrast to the situation in d. melanogaster , highly purified lps and lta are inducers of amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though not as potently as crude lps ( with contaminating pgn ) or purified pgn [ 85 , 90 , 96 , 97 ] . this raises the possibility that different mamps or combinations of mamps are most efficacious in eliciting amp gene expression in lepidoptera relative to diptera . also , since purified lps can elicit amp expression in lepidoptera but not d. melanogaster , lepidoptera have either a distinct repertoire of prrs responsible for lps - dependent triggering of imd or toll pathways , or an as - yet undiscovered pathway that links lps to amp induction . testing these ideas awaits the identification of the suite of prrs and signal transduction pathways responsible for transducing lps , lta , pgn , or combinatorial microbial signals to amp gene expression . one class of lepidopteran prr that may mediate infection - dependent induction of amps is the c - type lectins ( ctls ) , ca - dependent , secreted proteins that have carbohydrate - binding capabilities . similar to some ctls of d. melanogaster , several ctls of m. sexta   and b. mori [ 54 , 99 ] are reported to mediate induction of cellular responses and the propo cascade . although the nomenclature quickly becomes confusing , ctls include lipopolysaccharide - binding protein ( lbp ) . m. sexta iml-1 binds to gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria as well as yeast , iml-2 shows specific binding to lps , iml-3 and iml-4 show specific binding to lps and lta , and iml-3 can also bind laminarin , a -1,3-glucan [ 103 , 104 ] . diversity in ctl carbohydrate - binding specificities may result in lineage - specific pathogen recognition - signal transduction connections . of particular relevance to the theme of this review are prrs present in lepidoptera but not diptera ( table 1 ) . in general , both orders of insects encode grps and pgrps . however , specific representatives of each class are restricted to lepidoptera ( table 1 ) . for example , the lepidopteran grp-2 , which binds fungal cell wall -1,3 glucans   and lta , is absent from diptera . such derived grp and pgrps may contribute to lepidopteran - specific transduction of signals to downstream pathways . other lepidoptera - specific prrs are hemolin and hemolymph proteinase-14 precursor ( prohp14 ) ( table 1 ) . like iml c - type lectins , hemolin is an lps- and lta - binding prr   with roles in mediating cellular responses and as an opsonin to enhance phagocytosis . hp14 has been shown to detect and bind a broad range of mamps , and may coordinate with grp1 or grp2 to activate propo [ 60 , 106 ] . the potential role of the prrs discussed above in mediating the expression of amp genes remains to be determined , and further study of the lepidoptera - specific immune surveillance proteins and divergent activities of conserved prrs likely will yield novel avenues for pest - control . d. melanogaster has both mamp - dependent and mamp - independent routes to activate the toll pathway . in mamp - dependent toll induction , bacterial lys - pgn ( typical of gram - positive bacteria ) is detected by pgrp - sa or pgrp - sd ( in the presence of gnbp-1 ) , while yeast or fungal -1,3-glucan is detected by gnbp-3 [ 85 , 108 , 109 ] ( figure 1 ) . mamp - independent stimuli are virulence determinants , such as proteases and chitinases , secreted by microbes and dubbed  mamps and mamp - independent stimuli each trigger a distinct proteolytic cascade   that both culminate in cleavage of the cytokine sptzle by the serine protease sptzle processing enzyme ( spe ) . interaction of active sptzle c - terminal domain ( c-106 ) with the surface - localized toll receptor triggers an intracellular signal transduction terminating in induced expression of amps and cellular responses . some of the basic components of the toll pathway are present in lepidoptera ( figure 2 ) . m. sexta hemocytes express an infection - induced toll - like receptor and the genome of b. mori encodes 14 genes predicted to encode toll - like receptors as well as homologs of each of the intracellular components of toll - dependent signaling [ 85 , 114 , 115 ] . both m. sexta and b. mori encode homologs of the d. melanogaster toll - activating cytokine sptzle   ( figure 2 ) . also , for both m. sexta and b. mori there is experimental evidence linking the toll pathway with amp induction [ 116118 ] . in m. sexta , toll pathway results in expression of several antimicrobial peptides , including attacin-1 , cecropin-6 , moricin and lysozyme . in addition , the transcript level of hemolin , a pattern recognition protein exclusive to lepidopterans ( table 1 ) , is induced by injection of activated sptzle - c108 into larvae . despite the conservation of certain aspects of the toll pathway , the extracellular cascades that lead to sptzle activation may have diverged between d. melanogaster and the two lepidoptera ( figure 1 ) . for example , in contrast to what is known in d. melanogaster , the m. sexta toll pathway is activated by gram - negative - associated mamps [ 115 , 118 ] . also , the genome of b. mori lacks 1:1 orthologs of grass , spirit and persephone , the d. melanogaster serine proteases responsible for mamp / prr - dependent and mamp - independent cleavage of spe ( figure 1 ) . progress has been made in identifying a m. sexta proteolytic cascade that results in processing pro - sptzle into its active c - terminal domain ( c-108 ) . the direct cleavage is mediated by hemolymph proteinase ( hp ) 8 [ 11 , 13 ] , a homolog of d. melanogaster spe , in turn , hp8 is processed into its active form by hp6 . hp6 is most similar to d. melanogaster persephone protease , which activates spe in response to mamp - independent stimuli [ 110 , 113 ] . this hemolymph proteinase is activated in response to gram - positive or gram - negative bacteria and in response to -1,3-glucan . however , the prrs and proteolytic cascade that transduce mamp signals to amp induction are unknown ( figure 1 ) . the findings reviewed above demonstrate that while the overall architecture of the toll pathway is conserved among insects , the specific identities of proteolytic cascade members are distinct and many gaps remain in our understanding of toll activation in lepidoptera . filling these gaps should reveal potential lineage - specific molecules that can serve as targets to hinder the activation of the toll pathway in agricultural pests . in d. melanogaster the imd pathway also contributes to amp gene induction and is triggered by direct interaction of dap - pgn , a mamp typical of gram - negative bacteria , with the transmembrane receptor pgrp - lc [ 82 , 83 , 125 , 126 ] . for example , pgrp - le can act as an intracellular receptor for monomeric pgn   and its truncated form can enhance pgrp - lc - mediated recognition . dap - pgn / pgrp - lc interaction activates intracellular imd , which then recruits fas - associated death domain ( fadd ) and death - related ced-3/nedd2-like protein ( dredd ) to form a complex [ 129 , 130 ] . current evidence supports the idea that dredd , a caspase - like molecule , cleaves the nf-b transcription factor relish . imd also appears to activate a phosphorelay : the transforming growth factor- ( tgf)-activated kinase 1 ( tak1 ) phosphorylates the ikb kinase ( ikk )  relish cleavage into its activated amino - terminal transcriptional regulator domain allows its translocation into the nucleus , where it activates amp gene expression . the translocation of relish into the nucleus is regulated by two recently discovered components of this pathway : inhibitor of apoptosis 2 ( iap2 ) and transforming growth factor - activated kinase 1 ( tak1)-binding protein 2 ( tab2 ) [ 132 , 133 ] . both , iap2 and tab2 act upstream of relish and downstream of imd , while iap2 functions downstream of tak1 [ 132 , 134 ] . of particular importance to amp gene expression is iap2 , the knockdown of which hampers the sustained expression of amp genes . while iap2 and tab2 are necessary for imd signal transduction , the gene product of pirk , a recently characterized gene , interacts directly with imd and pgrp - lc . pirk overexpression analyses revealed that it acts as a negative regulator by reducing the expression of the amp genes attacin b , cecropin b , and diptericin b , which are all under the control of the imd pathway . most of the information available about the imd pathway in lepidoptera comes from bioinformatics ; orthologs of all intracellular components of the imd pathway have been found in b. mori [ 54 , 137 ] and m. sexta . however , few experiments have been done to characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of the imd pathway in these insects . in m. sexta several genes of the imd pathway , including those encoding imd , fadd , tak1 , dredd and relish are up regulated in fat body of immune challenged 5th instar larvae   and in the midgut of b. mori during the wandering stage . genes encoding lysozyme , moricin and defensin amps also were up regulated in the midgut of b. mori in the wandering stage , consistent with the possibility that amp induction is imd - mediated . finally , in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua , rnai - mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection , further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though perhaps it is triggered by distinct signals . further study is needed to elucidate imd - mediated amp induction in lepidoptera and to reveal any differences there are in this pathway between diptera and lepidoptera . in d. melanogaster , transcription of amp - encoding genes is activated by the nf-b family transcription factors in response to infection [ 6569 ] with distinct nf-b family transcription factors responding to the toll and immune deficiency ( imd ) signal transduction pathways . in response to toll pathway activation , the nf-b inhibitor cactus is phosphorylated and degraded allowing its targets , the nf-b factors dif and dorsal , to be translocated to the nucleus . imd pathway activity culminates in the nf-b factor relish being activated by a stimulus - induced proteolytic cleavage . in the case of dif and dorsal , gram - positive bacterial and fungal infections primarily serve as the stimuli that induce degradation of cactus through the toll signaling pathway . in general , gram - negative bacterial infections of d. melanogaster stimulate the proteolytic cleavage of relish through the imd pathway . once in the nucleus , these transcription factors drive the transcription of immune effectors , including amp genes whose promoters contain nf-b binding sites [ 70 , 72 ] . overall , nf-b proteins and their dna - binding specificities are conserved among organisms , including those lepidoptera studied to date [ 73 , 74 ] . however , the nfb - binding regions for inhibitor of b ( ib ) proteins ( e.g. , cactus ) are not conserved , suggesting diversification and co - adaptation between ib and nfb pairs . also , recent work indicates that nf-b nuclear co - regulators may contribute to species - specific regulation of amp gene expression . therefore , modulation of inhibitors and nuclear - co - regulators of nf-b - dependent transcription may be one avenue by which target - specific immune suppression could be achieved . in d. melanogaster , nf-b - dependent amp induction through the toll and imd pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) . prrs are soluble or membrane -

regulated in fat body after immune challenge and shows specific binding to lta , lps , dap - pgn . also , in contrast to the situation in d. melanogaster , highly purified lps and lta are inducers of amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though not as potently as crude lps ( with contaminating pgn ) or purified pgn [ 85 , 90 , 96 , 97 ] . this raises the possibility that different mamps or combinations of mamps are most efficacious in eliciting amp gene expression in lepidoptera relative to diptera . also , since purified lps can elicit amp expression in lepidoptera but not d. melanogaster , lepidoptera have either a distinct repertoire of prrs responsible for lps -

specific molecules that can serve as targets to hinder the activation of the toll pathway in agricultural pests . in d. melanogaster the imd pathway also contributes to amp gene induction and is triggered by direct interaction of dap - pgn , a mamp typical of gram - negative bacteria , with the transmembrane receptor pgrp - lc [ 82 , 83 , 125 , 126 ] . for example , pgrp - le can act as an intracellular receptor for monomeric pgn   and its truncated form can enhance pgrp - lc - mediated recognition . dap - pgn / pgrp - lc interaction activates intracellular imd , which then recruits fas - associated death domain ( fadd ) and death - related ced-3/nedd2-like protein ( dredd ) to form a complex [ 129 , 130 ] . current evidence supports the idea that dredd , a caspase - like molecule , cleaves the nf-b transcription factor relish . imd also appears to activate a phosphorelay : the transforming growth factor- ( tgf)-activated kinase 1 ( tak1 ) phosphorylates the ikb kinase ( ikk )  relish cleavage into its activated amino - terminal transcriptional regulator domain allows its translocation into the nucleus , where it activates amp gene expression . the translocation of relish into the nucleus is regulated by two recently discovered components of this pathway : inhibitor of apoptosis 2 ( iap2 ) and transforming growth factor - activated kinase 1 ( tak1)-binding protein 2 ( tab2 ) [ 132 , 133 ] . both , iap2 and tab2 act upstream of relish and downstream of imd , while iap2 functions downstream of tak1 [ 132 , 134 ] . of particular importance to amp gene expression is iap2 , the knockdown of which hampers the sustained expression of amp genes . while iap2 and tab2 are necessary for imd signal transduction , the gene product of pirk , a recently characterized gene , interacts directly with imd and pgrp - lc . pirk overexpression analyses revealed that it acts as a negative regulator by reducing the expression of the amp genes attacin b , cecropin b , and diptericin b , which are all under the control of the imd pathway . most of the information available about the imd pathway in lepidoptera comes from bioinformatics ; orthologs of all intracellular components of the imd pathway have been found in b. mori [ 54 , 137 ] and m. sexta . however , few experiments have been done to characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of the imd pathway in these insects . in m. sexta several genes of the imd pathway , including those encoding imd , fadd , tak1 , dredd and relish are up regulated in fat body of immune challenged 5th instar larvae   and in the midgut of b. mori during the wandering stage . genes encoding lysozyme , moricin and defensin amps also were up regulated in the midgut of b. mori in the wandering stage , consistent with the possibility that amp induction is imd - mediated . finally , in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua , rnai - mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection , further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though perhaps it is triggered by distinct signals . further study is needed to elucidate imd - mediated amp induction in lepidoptera and to reveal any differences there are in this pathway between diptera and lepidoptera . insecticides are necessary to guarantee effective insect pest management in agricultural settings . however , the cost and off - target effects of these insecticides directly and indirectly increase economic burden ; the latter by affecting beneficial arthropods such as pollinators . the study of insect immunity can provide tools for the development of target - specific cost - effective approaches to control agricultural pests . directed suppression of pest immune defenses is predicted to render them susceptible to environmental and applied biocontrol pathogens , as recently demonstrated in termites by bulmer and colleagues . the studies summarized above suggest that many aspects of insect immunity , including recognition factors and serine proteases , have diverged between d. melanogaster and lepidoptera . continued comparative immunity of a broad array of species from diptera , lepidoptera , and other insect orders will reveal possible candidate immunity factors for target - specific approaches that will enable the effective control of insect pests . however , before such approaches can be realized , the details of lepidopteran immune signaling pathways must be elucidated . the relatively large sizes of last instar larvae of many lepidopteran species will facilitate biochemical approaches to such studies , while the establishment of immune - inducible lepidopteran cell lines such as the uga - cie1 cell line   can enable the characterization of molecular mechanisms leading to imd pathway activation and its contribution to amp gene expression . finally , ongoing investigations into the immune - modulatory mechanisms of entomopathogens will help identify key steps in immunity that are susceptible to manipulation , contributing to the development of natural , cost - effective , non - toxic alternatives to chemical insecticides currently used for pest management .', 'hypertension , diabetes mellitus and obesity together form 24% of the global risk for mortality . cardiovascular disorders related to these life - style diseases form the major cause of morbidity and mortality among the sufferers worldwide . obesity has become a global epidemic in the past few decades . among the adult us population , 33.8% are obese , and another 34.2% are overweight . obesity is a risk factor for many diseases of which hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus are the most important . obese individuals ( those with body mass index ( bmi ) more than 30  kg / m ) were found to have higher risk for diabetes mellitus ( age - adjusted odds ratio ( or ) = 3.66 ) and hypertension ( age - adjusted or = 3.72 ) compared to those with normal body weight . overweight individuals also had higher risk for diabetes and hypertension ( age - adjusted or = 1.59 and 1.88 , resp . ) and those with morbid obesity ( bmi > 40  kg / m ) had the highest risk ( age - adjusted or = 7.37 and 6.38 , resp . ) . as there is a significant linear relationship between body weight and these two diseases , control of excess bodyweight is important for their prevention and treatment .   over the past few decades , a lot of effective drugs have been developed for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes . however , the pharmacotherapy of obesity is still not very promising without lifestyle modification and/or surgical intervention . therefore , we aim to discuss the treatment options without drugs for management of hypertension and diabetes in obesity through this paper . aerobic exercise has shown to be associated with reduction of systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) by 3.84  mm  hg   and diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) by 2.58  mm hg in a meta - analysis examining large data from 54 randomized controlled trials . more profound reduction of sbp ( 14.77  mm  hg ) and dbp ( 5.63  mm  hg ) has been observed in a recent study among obese patients after a 12-month regular exercise program along with dietary changes . significant reduction in body weight and cardiometabolic parameters like insulin resistance and hepatic fat also have been observed among the participants in this study . regular exercise along with dietary modifications has shown to be associated with significantly greater reduction in both sbp ( 4.5  mm  hg ) and dbp ( 2.4  mm  hg ) when compared with dietary adjustments alone among hypertensive patients . weight loss has been found to be associated with a decrease in arterial stiffness [ 8 , 9 ] . better control of blood pressure among obese hypertensives following weight loss may be partly due to the reduction in arterial stiffness . even minor reduction in the body weight has been associated with better control of hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors .   an average weight loss of 3.0  kg through lifestyle interventions corresponded 2.5 years later with a 30% reduction in combined cardiovascular events , poorly controlled blood pressure and the need to reinitiate antihypertensive medications . reductions in total body and abdominal fat , even without significant weight loss achieved through regular exercise , were found to be associated with improved sbp , dbp and cardiovascular risk factors . diet , exercise , and weight loss intervention trial ( dew - it ) showed that exercise - incorporated lifestyle interventions can result in significantly better bp control among patients taking pharmacotherapy for hypertension . insulin resistance is the major cause for hyperglycemia in obese diabetics and physical activity is one of the best ways to reduce insulin resistance [ 7 , 1416 ] . hepatic lipid accumulation is one of the primary mechanisms that drive obesity - related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes , and exercise can reduce the free fatty acid - induced hepatic insulin resistance . reversal of hepatic insulin resistance is related to the reduction in central adiposity induced by exercise . weight loss achieved by regular exercise was found to improve hepatic insulin sensitivity better than weight loss induced through calorie restriction . exercise can also reduce hepatic glucose production and augment insulin - mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output [ 14 , 17 ] .    this effect is mediated by an increase in expression of glucose transporter 4 ( glut 4 , an isoform of glucose transporter ) in skeletal muscle . exercise also induces an increase in muscle insulin sensitivity . through these adaptations in the muscle , physical activity improves the peripheral glucose disposal and insulin resistance , and augments the glycemic control among obese individuals with diabetes .   aerobic exercise has been demonstrated to improve the insulin sensitivity and reduce the glycemic load , without any significant change in energy intake , among obese men and women , and exercise may have a synergistic effect to reduce insulin resistance when combined with a low glycemic diet . despite the absence of weight loss , moderate - intensity exercise was associated with significant reductions in visceral obesity ( an important determinant of insulin resistance ) among obese individuals with type 2 diabetes .   look ahead ( action for health and diabetes ) is a us national institutes of health - funded long - term multicentric clinical trial studying the effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention on cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) morbidity and mortality in overweight / obese people with type 2 diabetes . weight loss achieved by exercise and dietary changes among the intervention group resulted in better glycemic control and cvd risk factors . reduced medication use and lower therapeutic costs were the other benefits observed among this group after one year .    diabetes prevention program ( dpp ) was a prospective multi - centre randomized clinical trial examining the diabetes incidence in overweight / obese adults managed with intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin or placebo . exercise - incorporated lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 58% and metformin by 31% when compared with placebo after 2.8 years of follow up . decreased diabetes risk by lifestyle intervention observed in the dpp trial was related to reductions of body weight , bmi , and central adiposity . follow up data from the trial has shown that the cumulative incidence of diabetes remained lowest in the lifestyle intervention group even after 10 years .     the dietary approaches to stop hypertension ( dash ) trial was a multicenter , randomized clinical trial that examined the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure . this landmark study showed that a diet rich in fruits , vegetables and low - fat diary products along with reduced saturated and total fat lowered systolic blood pressure by 5.5  mm hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.0  mm hg more than a control diet . for overweight or obese persons , the addition of exercise and weight loss to the dash diet resulted in even larger bp reductions and cardiac risk factors .   dietary sodium restriction ( to <3  grams / day ) is an important component of management of any patient with hypertension . overweight / obese hypertensives were found to have higher salt sensitivity in observational studies [ 27 , 28 ] . obese subjects were also found to have an enhanced rate of renal tubular sodium reabsorption . animal studies showed that obesity is associated with salt retention by the kidney through reduction of natriuresis ( increased clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide by adipose cells ) , increased sympathetic activity and activation of renin angiotensin - aldosterone system ( and high blood pressure as a consequence ) . hence , the beneficial effect of salt restriction would be more profound among obese hypertensives . a recent large population - based study reported from china adds evidence to this concept .   a long - term dietary intervention trial with a nutrient - fortified prepared meal plan ( approximately 22% energy from fat , 58% from carbohydrate and 20% from protein ) was found to be associated with better control of bp among obese / overweight hypertensives than with the usual care diet . the dietary intervention group in this study also achieved better weight loss and improved cardiovascular risk factors . combining a daily fish meal with a weight - loss diet has an additive effect on blood pressure among overweight hypertensives .   a systematic review to determine the long - term effects of weight loss on hypertension through dietary interventions versus pharmacologic treatment showed that the former approach resulted in greater weight loss and bp reductions than the latter . the american dietetic association recommends the application of medical nutrition therapy ( mnt ) and lifestyle counseling as an integral component of the medical treatment for management of specific disease states and conditions ( including hypertension and obesity ) and should be the initial step in the management of these situations . when pharmacotherapy becomes necessary for control , mnt may complement or enhance its therapeutic effectiveness , thereby reducing or eliminating the need for multiple medications . excess alcohol consumption is well known to raise the blood pressure in human beings .   however , social drinking may not be very hazardous . according to the european society of hypertension and cardiology recommendation , alcohol consumption in hypertensive subjects who drink alcohol should be limited to no more than 20 to 30  gm of ethanol per day for men and no more than 10 to 20  gm for women . in obese hypertensives , low levels of drinking may help to reduce calorie consumption and thus may facilitate weight reduction . overall , weight reduction achieved through lifestyle interventions like dietary modification and regular exercise programs ( at least 30 minutes / day on most days ) help obese individuals with hypertension to obtain better bp control and reduce complications related to uncontrolled hypertension . nutritional intervention is of paramount importance in preventing diabetes , managing existing diabetes and preventing / slowing diabetic complications . total calorie intake can be distributed as follows in a type 2 diabetic : 4565% of total calorie intake as carbohydrate , 1030% as proteins and less than 30% as total fat ( < 7% saturated fat ) with < 300  mg / day of cholesterol . macronutrient intake should be tailored according to the metabolic status of the patient ( e.g. , lipid profile ) . similarly , there is no evidence - based recommendation for generalization of micronutrient supplements .   for obese diabetic , a weight losing diet containing either low - carbohydrate or low - fat calorie - restricted diet may be effective in the short term ( up to 1 year ) . standard weight loss diets provide 5001,000 fewer calories than estimated to be necessary for weight maintenance . up to 10% of weight loss can be achieved in 6 months with such diets . lipid profiles , renal function and protein intake ( in those with nephropathy ) of patients on low - carbohydrate - diets should be monitored and adjustments of hypoglycemic drug therapy should be made to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia . maintenance of weight loss after one year usually depends on the adherence to lifestyle interventions . intensive individualized dietary advice ( according to the nutritional recommendations of the european association for the study of diabetes ) for six months has shown to reduce hba1c by 0.4% , body weight by 1.3  kg , bmi by 0.5  kg / m and waist circumference by 1.6  cm when compared to controls , among overweight / obese diabetics on optimal medical treatment without adequate glycemic control .   a carbohydrate intake of 130 grams / day is recommended for patients as this provides adequate glucose for the central nervous system , without reliance on glucose production from ingested protein or fat , for its fuel needs . long - term metabolic effects of very - low - carbohydrate diets on brain are unclear ( though brain may function even on lower carbohydrate diets ) and such diets may result in imbalance of energy , fiber , vitamins and minerals , and may not be palatable . few surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract , collectively termed as bariatric surgery , have emerged as important therapeutic options for management of obesity in the recent years . they are classified as purely restrictive ( limiting the stomach volume ) and primarily malabsorptive . restrictive procedures commonly used now are laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy . the main malabsorptive procedure in use now is roux - en - y gastric bypass . calorie restriction may be through three mechanisms in bariatric surgery : ( 1 ) mechanical limiting of volume of the gastric pouch and reduction of its outlet ( 2 ) modulation of satiety by postprandial induction of neuro - hormonal signals ( e.g. , peptide yy , an anorexiant ) and ( 3 ) restriction of calorie intake spontaneously adopted by patients to limit the burden of postprandial dumping syndrome . significant weight loss following the surgery usually results in improvement of diabetes and hypertension .    a recent meta - analysis that included 621 studies with 888 treatment arms and 135,246 patients has shown that the weight loss overall was 38.5  kg or 55.9% excess body weight loss . overall , 78.1% of diabetic patients had complete resolution and diabetes was improved or resolved in 86.6% of patients . improvement of diabetes usually occurs days after surgery even before significant weight loss is achieved . apart from calorie restriction obtained through the procedure , improvement of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity ( mainly related to weight loss ) also contributes to better glycemic control among obese diabetic patients undergoing bariatric surgery . other proposed mechanisms are through release of gut hormones like glucagon - like peptide-1 and glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( the incretin effect ) and increase in the beta - cell mass .   hypertension was resolved in 61.7% and resolved or improved in 78.5% of patients undergoing bariatric procedures . one percent reduction in body weight will decrease systolic blood pressure by 1  mm hg and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mm hg . reduction in salt sensitivity and alteration of renal hemodynamics brought about by weight loss may be the contributing factors for improvement of hypertension following bariatric surgery . a 14  mm  hg reduction in sbp and 12  mm hg reduction in dbp was observed among obese hypertensives undergoing bariatric surgery in a recent clinical trial . discontinuation/ reduction of dose of antihypertensive medication can be achieved in many patients following bariatric surgery . a recent study showed the distinct advantages of bariatric surgery over lifestyle interventions for treatment of obesity and related diseases like hypertension and diabetes . the mean weight loss at one year was 30% and 8% in the surgical and lifestyle intervention groups , respectively . remission rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in the surgery group than in the lifestyle intervention group ( 70 versus 33% and 49 versus 23% ) . bariatric surgery is a relatively safe ( perioperative mortality rate 0.3% ) procedure with only a few adverse consequences ( 4.3% ) . the most frequent and severe adverse events in the immediate postprocedure period are anastomotic leaks , hemorrhage and thromboembolic events . long - term hazards are vitamin deficiencies , malnutrition , osteoporosis , psychiatric disorders and a slightly higher risk of accidental death [ 41 , 46 ] . however , a swedish study showed significantly reduced 10-year mortality risk with bariatric surgery when compared to nonsurgical treatment of obesity , making this treatment option a promise for many .      the scottish intercollegiate guidelines network ( sign ) recommends that bariatric surgery may be considered for patients with all three of the following : ( a ) bmi of 35 or more , ( b ) one or more severe comorbidities that are expected to have a meaningful clinical improvement with weight reduction ( e.g. , severe mobility problems , arthritis , type 2 diabetes ) , and ( c ) evidence of completion of a structured weight management program that covered diet , physical activity , and psychological and drug interventions but did not result in significant and sustained improvement in co - morbidities . the most recent diabetes surgery summit consensus conference recommends bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetic patients with severe obesity ( bmi > 35  kg / m ) as well as in carefully selected , moderately obese patients ( bmi : 3035  kg / m ) who are inadequately controlled by conventional medical and behavioral therapies .      weight loss achieved through lifestyle interventions like dietary adjustments and regular physical activity are safe and moderately effective measures for management of hypertension and diabetes in obesity . they also help to reduce the treatment costs related to pharmacotherapy and also to reduce the pill burden . even when drug therapy is considered , lifestyle interventions should continue , to obtain the desired effects of medications . bariatric surgery is more effective than lifestyle interventions for treatment and is remarkably safe in selected patient groups . these non - pharmacological interventions should be the first - line management option and should also be combined with pharmacotherapy for scientific treatment of these diseases .']\n"
